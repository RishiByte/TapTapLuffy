Tap the keys and watch **Luffy** play music!  
A fun, interactive rhythm project inspired by the classic Bongo Cat meme — now with a **One Piece** twist.

---

## About the idea

**TapTapLuffy** is inspired by the viral **Bongo Cat** meme, reimagined with *Monkey D. Luffy* from **One Piece**.  
Each key press triggers a sound while Luffy reacts in real time, creating a playful and satisfying musical experience.

This project is built mainly for:
- Fun 🎶  
- Learning JavaScript event handling  
- Exploring low-latency audio playback
